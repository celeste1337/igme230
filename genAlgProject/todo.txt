THINGS I DONT UNDERSTAND::
[] is there an if/else that needs to surround the for loop that walks through indexes 0-8 in new gen stuff?

[] doesnt inserting the nextgen just add more to the population array? is population array supposed to "store" the history of the program? -- is it ever supposed to reset/be emptied ?? //dumb question


THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE::

[x] build method in Genetics
    [x] breed one new kid using selection, crossover, and mutation
    [x] breed1() method has NO parameters
        [x] select() one parent
        [x] select() the other parent
        [x] crossover on the two parents to create a new kid
        [x] mutate the kid
        [x] return the chromosome
    [x] make another button for breed1()
[] generate a new generation in Main
    [x] in a function called by a breedGen button
        [x] set up a local array in the function to store the next gen chroms
        [] once that has 9 new chroms, run a for loop that walks through the array
        [x] uses each chrom to insert/update an individual in the genetics object at a specific index
        [x] reset the corresponding huegrid in the array of huegrids at the same index
[x] elitism function in Genetics
    [x] takes no parameters
    [x] returns the chrom of ONE that has the highest fitness
[x] breeding new generation algorithm
    [x] declare local array for next gen of chroms
    [x] find an individual with highest fitness using method you built
    [x] insert best individuals chromosome into nextGen at 0
    [x] for index 1-8
        [x] breed1() a new chrom and insert it into next gen at [index]
    [x] for index 0-8
        [x] insert nextgen[index] into genetics class population array [index] with fitness value of 0
        [x] use nextgen[index] to reset() huegrid in your huegrid array at [index]
[] error check
[] all done! good job! :)
