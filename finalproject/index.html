            <p>This is my final project for IGME230. I'm using the PixiJS framework. Let's go click on stuff! Take a (short) journey with me!</p>

            <h2>Documentation</h2>
            <p>I used a lot in this project! <br>
                Audience: Anyone looking for something to waste some time and possible employers.<br>
                Goal: Create 3 “scenes” to convey different feelings, but with the same art style and “feeling” in
                terms of interactivity. My ultimate goal is to convey a moment in time instead of show something fancy.
                I want it to convey my personal art style while retaining the functionality that makes it simple and
                satisfying to use.<br>

                How/When/Why: Ideally, they’d come upon my website through looking at my portfolio. I’d also consider
                what I wanted to make as a “game”, so maybe if they were looking for things on itch.io they could find
                my graphics! I hope they would find my site when they look at my portfolio, or want to look at my web
                development skills for a co-op.<br>
                I wanted this website to feel sketchy, messy, and exactly reflect my art style (quick doodles on the
                corners of notes). I also wanted it to be casual, which I think is reflected in the typeface choices. I
                don't really want to give the impression that anything is serious or too stiff. Web design is fun! All
                my colors were meant to be dreamy-cute and fun. I think pink is a great color!</p>
            <p>I used (in no particular order):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Everything that the PixiJS tutorials/examples/documentation folks offer on their website, but
                    particularly the tutorial by kittykatattack. Almost all of that is verbatim from her tutorial, with
                    variable names changed, just because I hadn't used Pixi before.</li>
                <li>Stuff on object-fit I got from StackOverflow and MDN.</li>
                <li>SVG styling help from StackOverflow (mostly the fact that you can do CSS styling with jQuery on
                    SVGs).</li>
                <li>The jQuery docs themselves!</li>
                <li>An extreme amount of w3schools and MDN, especially for scroll-behavior.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In terms of above and beyond, most of my stuff came from just learning the PixiJS docs. I spent about 4
                hours learning about renderers and everything that Pixi is built on and used a jQuery offset to place
                the immensely large canvas so it wouldn't start on the first page. Besides that, I think the horizontal
                site and the cool scroll behavior stuff is interesting. I thought about having "one" site with all the
                graphics immensely off the page then flying in with CSS transitions, but ultimately scroll-behavior and
                id tags were way easier, which I didn't know about before!<br>
                There were a lot of things I struggled with on this project. I really didn't understand jQuery as much
                as I thought I did, and this project really pushed my limits on understanding how jQuery actually
                works. I also got a very quick lesson on how pixiJS handles multiple canvases (it doesn't), so I really
                had to figure out how to recover from a lot of lost time.<br> Project by Celeste Yost for IGME230.
